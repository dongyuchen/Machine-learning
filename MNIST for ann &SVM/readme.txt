My program is writen by python3. And use scikit-learn==0.20.3 to save the model. If your scikit-learn version is not 0.20.3, it may error.
Also i use numpy==1.16.0, if your numpy version is not 1.16.0, it may error.

In the command line, run the program in this director by using the following command to check the model "ANN": python test.py 
If you want to see the result of the model "SVM", by using : python test.py --model SVM
